# GitHub Push Status

Attempted to push the repository to `git@github.com:greenreach2024/Realestate-Reach.git` using the following commands:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:greenreach2024/Realestate-Reach.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

The push failed because the execution environment cannot reach GitHub over SSH:

```
ssh: connect to host github.com port 22: Network is unreachable
```

No repository data was transferred. Re-run the push from a network with access to GitHub or use HTTPS with appropriate credentials.
