# GitHub Desktop Save Status

The request referenced commit `3c6e1738af0f4ff03a1d1b8c25c90b1ca0d1e333`. After pulling the latest history for the Buyer Registry workspace, that commit is not present in the local repository. Use the steps below to capture the current work into GitHub Desktop instead.

## 1. Refresh the repository history

1. Open **GitHub Desktop**.
2. Select the **Light-Engine-Charlie** repository from the repository switcher.
3. Click **Repository â–¸ Pull** to ensure the local history matches `work`.
4. Confirm that the most recent entry is `docs: add local github saving guide` (commit `e300740`). If the desired commit ID is missing, it has not been created yet in this repository.

## 2. Stage current work for a new commit

1. In **GitHub Desktop**, review the **Changes** tab.
2. Check the files that should be saved to a commit. Uncheck any files you do not want to include.
3. Verify that newly created documentation (for example, under the `docs/` directory) is staged.

## 3. Create a new commit in GitHub Desktop

1. Enter a descriptive **Summary**, e.g., `Save Git Desktop instructions`.
2. Optionally add a **Description** noting why the commit is being captured.
3. Press **Commit to work**. GitHub Desktop generates a new commit with a new SHA.

> **Note:** Git automatically assigns a new commit hash for every commit. You cannot force GitHub Desktop to reuse a specific SHA such as `3c6e1738af0f4ff03a1d1b8c25c90b1ca0d1e333`. If that SHA was referenced elsewhere, recreate the same changes and commit message; Git will generate a different hash.

## 4. Push the commit to GitHub

1. Click **Push origin** to sync the commit to the remote.
2. Verify on GitHub that the new commit appears in the history.

Following these steps ensures the current repository state is safely stored via GitHub Desktop, even though the referenced commit SHA is not part of this project history.
