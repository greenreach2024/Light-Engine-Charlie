# IoT Devices Panel Fix

**Date**: October 17, 2025
**Issue**: Devices accepted from Universal Scanner not appearing in IoT Devices panel and not being removed from scanner table

## Problems Identified

1. **Devices not showing in IoT Devices panel**: Accepted devices were being filtered into "Unknown Devices" table instead of displaying as proper device cards
2. **No visual feedback**: Users couldn't see their accepted devices properly displayed
3. **No persistence on reload**: IoT devices weren't being loaded on page refresh
4. **Poor UX**: No automatic navigation to IoT panel after accepting a device

## Root Causes

### Issue 1: Overly Restrictive Filtering
**File**: `public/app.charlie.js` (line 1582)

The `renderIoTDeviceCards()` function filtered devices as "unknown" if:
- `!d.vendor` OR
- `d.vendor === 'Unknown'` OR  
- `!d.type` OR
- `d.trust === 'unknown'` OR
- `d.trust === undefined`

This meant any device with vendor='Unknown' (the default fallback) was categorized as "unknown" and shown in a configuration table instead of as a proper device card.

### Issue 2: No Panel Navigation
After accepting a device, users stayed on the Integrations panel and couldn't easily see where the device went.

### Issue 3: No Data Persistence Loading
The `loadAllData()` function didn't load `iot-devices.json` from the server, so saved devices weren't restored on page refresh.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Device Card Rendering

**File**: `public/app.charlie.js` (lines 1573-1582)

**Before**:
```javascript
const unknowns = devices.filter(d => 
  !d.vendor || d.vendor === 'Unknown' || !d.type || 
  d.trust === 'unknown' || d.trust === undefined
);
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Identify unknown devices: ONLY devices with trust='unknown' or undefined
// Accepted devices should always show as cards even if vendor is 'Unknown'
const unknowns = devices.filter(d => 
  d.trust === 'unknown' || d.trust === undefined
);
```

**Rationale**: Trust level is the only reliable indicator. Accepted devices have `trust: 'trusted'` so they should always display as proper cards, regardless of vendor name.

### 2. Enhanced Device Cards

**File**: `public/app.charlie.js` (lines 1648-1700)

Added rich device cards with:
- **Visual Design**: White cards with shadows, borders, and proper spacing
- **Device Info**: Name, protocol badge, address/IP, model
- **Action Buttons**: View (shows JSON details) and Remove
- **Vendor Grouping**: Devices grouped by vendor with count badges
- **Better Layout**: Grid layout with proper flex alignment

**Example Card Structure**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SwitchBot Devices [3]                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Tower 11                  [View][Remove]│
│ ├─ switchbot • D7A1234567              │
│ └─ WoIOSensor                          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Grow Room 3 - Zone 1      [View][Remove]│
│ ├─ switchbot • E8B9876543              │
│ └─ WoIOSensor                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3. Added Device Management Functions

**File**: `public/app.charlie.js` (lines 1703-1750)

Added two new global functions:

```javascript
// View full device details as JSON
window.viewDeviceDetails = function(deviceId) {
  // Shows device JSON in a toast notification
}

// Remove device from IoT panel
window.removeIoTDevice = function(deviceId) {
  // Removes from STATE and window.LAST_IOT_SCAN
  // Persists to server
  // Re-renders panel
}
```

### 4. Auto-Navigation to IoT Panel

**File**: `public/app.charlie.js` (lines 2203-2220)

After accepting a device:
1. Switch active nav button to IoT Devices
2. Hide all other panels
3. Show IoT Devices panel
4. Smooth scroll to panel top

**Code**:
```javascript
// Switch to IoT Devices panel to show the newly added device
const iotPanel = document.getElementById('iotPanel');
if (iotPanel) {
  // Trigger panel navigation
  const navButtons = document.querySelectorAll('.nav-button');
  navButtons.forEach(btn => btn.classList.remove('active'));
  const iotNavBtn = document.querySelector('[data-panel="iot-devices"]');
  if (iotNavBtn) iotNavBtn.classList.add('active');
  
  // Show IoT panel
  document.querySelectorAll('.card[data-panel]').forEach(p => p.style.display = 'none');
  iotPanel.style.display = 'block';
  
  // Scroll to top of panel
  iotPanel.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'start' });
}
```

### 5. Load IoT Devices on Startup

**File**: `public/app.charlie.js` (lines 9390-9402)

Added `iot-devices.json` to the data loading pipeline:

```javascript
const [groups, schedules, plans, /*...*/, iotDevicesData] = await Promise.all([
  loadJSON('./data/groups.json', { groups: [] }),
  // ... other files ...
  loadJSON('./data/iot-devices.json', [])
]);

STATE.iotDevices = Array.isArray(iotDevicesData) ? iotDevicesData : [];
window.LAST_IOT_SCAN = STATE.iotDevices;
console.log('✅ [loadAllData] Loaded IoT devices:', STATE.iotDevices.length);
setTimeout(() => {
  if (typeof window.renderIoTDeviceCards === 'function') {
    window.renderIoTDeviceCards(window.LAST_IOT_SCAN);
  }
}, 500);
```

### 6. Empty State Message

**File**: `public/app.charlie.js` (lines 1578-1580)

Added friendly message when no devices exist:

```javascript
if (!Array.isArray(devices) || !devices.length) {
  list.innerHTML = '<div style="padding: 24px; text-align: center; color: #64748b;">No devices added yet. Use the Universal Scanner to discover and add devices.</div>';
  return;
}
```

## User Flow (After Fix)

### Accepting a Device

1. **User Action**: Click "Accept" on a device in Universal Scanner
2. **Credential Check**: If SwitchBot device, prompt for API token/secret (once)
3. **Device Added**: 
   - Device added to `STATE.iotDevices` and `window.LAST_IOT_SCAN`
   - Saved to `/data/iot-devices.json` on server
4. **UI Updates**:
   - Device row fades out and removes from scanner table
   - Scanner count updates
   - **Panel switches to IoT Devices** (new!)
   - **Device card appears** in proper vendor section
   - Success toast notification
5. **Device Card Displays**:
   - Shows in vendor-grouped card (e.g., "SwitchBot Devices")
   - Displays name, protocol, address, model
   - Shows [View] and [Remove] buttons

### Viewing Device Details

1. Click **[View]** button on device card
2. Toast notification appears with full JSON
3. Duration: 10 seconds (vs default 3s)

### Removing a Device

1. Click **[Remove]** button on device card
2. Confirmation dialog: "Remove this device from IoT devices?"
3. If confirmed:
   - Device removed from `STATE.iotDevices` and `window.LAST_IOT_SCAN`
   - Updated list saved to `/data/iot-devices.json`
   - Panel re-renders
   - Success toast notification

### Page Reload

1. Browser refreshes or user returns later
2. `loadAllData()` fetches `/data/iot-devices.json`
3. Devices loaded into `STATE.iotDevices` and `window.LAST_IOT_SCAN`
4. IoT Devices panel renders all saved devices
5. Credentials and device info persist

- **Device Discovery**: `docs/DISCOVERY_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- **Data Persistence**: `SETUP_WIZARD_SYSTEM.md`

## Notes

- **Trust Levels**: 'trusted' (accepted), 'unknown' (needs config), 'quarantine' (blocked), 'ignored' (hidden)
- **Vendor Fallback**: If no vendor, defaults to 'Unknown' but still shows as proper card
- **Device ID**: Uses `deviceId`, `address`, or `id` for unique identification
- **Protocol Display**: Shows as colored badge (e.g., `switchbot`, `kasa-wifi`, `mqtt`)
- **Credentials**: Stored in plain JSON - production should encrypt
