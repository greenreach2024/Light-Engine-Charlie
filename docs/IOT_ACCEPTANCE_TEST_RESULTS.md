# IoT Device Acceptance - Test Results

**Date**: October 17, 2025, 6:35 PM
**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR TESTING**

## Pre-Flight Checks

### ✅ Code Fixes Applied
- [x] Line 2232: `addDeviceToIoT()` uses `/data/iot-devices.json` (was `/data/iot-devices`)
- [x] Line 1729: `removeIoTDevice()` uses `/data/iot-devices.json` (was `/data/iot-devices`)
- [x] Both endpoints now match server validation requirements

### ✅ Server Endpoint Verified
```bash
# Test 1: POST to /data/iot-devices.json
curl -X POST http://localhost:8091/data/iot-devices.json \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"test":"data"}]'

Response: {"ok":true} ✅
```

### ✅ File Creation Verified
```bash
# File created at: public/data/iot-devices.json
# Content: Valid JSON array with device objects
# Persistence: Survives server restart ✅
```

### ✅ Console Errors Explained

**Expected 404 on Load** (Normal Behavior):
```
[Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) (iot-devices.json, line 0)
[Warning] [loadJSON] Falling back for ./data/iot-devices.json: Error: HTTP 404
[Log] ✅ [loadAllData] Loaded IoT devices: 0
```

**Why This Is Normal**:
- File doesn't exist until first device is accepted
- `loadJSON()` has fallback logic that returns empty array `[]`
- System initializes with `STATE.iotDevices = []`
- No impact on functionality

**After First Device Accepted**:
- File will be created: `public/data/iot-devices.json`
- Future page loads will succeed: Status 200 OK
- Devices will persist across browser refreshes

## Test Simulation Results

### Simulated Device Acceptance

**Test Device Payload**:
```json
[{
  "name": "Test Device",
  "brand": "Unknown",
  "vendor": "Unknown",
  "protocol": "mdns",
  "type": "mdns",
  "deviceId": "test-123",
  "address": "192.168.2.100",
  "online": true,
  "trust": "trusted",
  "category": "network-service",
  "capabilities": [],
  "discoveredAt": "2025-10-17T18:30:00.000Z",
  "acceptedAt": "2025-10-17T18:30:05.000Z"
}]
```

**Results**:
- ✅ POST to `/data/iot-devices.json` returned `{"ok":true}`
- ✅ File created at `public/data/iot-devices.json`
- ✅ Content matches expected JSON structure
- ✅ No 400 Bad Request error
- ✅ No validation errors
- ✅ File cleaned up for fresh testing

## Manual Testing Steps

### Step 1: Hard Refresh Browser
```
macOS: Cmd+Shift+R
Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Shift+R
```

**Expected Console Output**:
```
✅ [loadAllData] Loaded IoT devices: 0
[Warning] [loadJSON] Falling back for ./data/iot-devices.json: Error: HTTP 404
```
This is normal - file doesn't exist yet.

### Step 2: Navigate to Integrations Panel
1. Click **Integrations** in sidebar
2. Scroll to **Universal Scanner** card
3. Click **Start Scan** button

**Expected**:
- Scan runs for ~5 seconds
- Results table populates with discovered devices
- Should see 20-30 devices (mDNS, SwitchBot, etc.)

### Step 3: Accept a Device
1. Find any device in results table (e.g., "GreenReach Farms")
2. Click **Accept** button
3. **If SwitchBot device**: Enter token/secret in modal, click Save
4. **If other device**: Acceptance is immediate

**Expected Console Output** (SUCCESS):
```
[Log] [UniversalScan] Accepting device: {device_id: "...", name: "...", ...}
[Log] [UniversalScan] Adding device to IoT: {name: "...", brand: "Unknown", ...}
[Log] [UniversalScan] IoT devices saved to server ✅
```

**Expected Console Output** (OLD - SHOULD NOT SEE):
```
❌ [Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 (Bad Request)
❌ [Warning] [UniversalScan] Failed to save IoT devices: "Bad Request"
```

**Expected UI Changes**:
1. ✅ Device row fades and disappears from scan table
2. ✅ Browser automatically switches to **IoT Devices** panel
3. ✅ Device appears as styled card in IoT Devices
4. ✅ Card shows: name, protocol badge, address, model
5. ✅ Card has **[View]** and **[Remove]** buttons
6. ✅ Success toast notification appears

### Step 4: Verify File Created
```bash
# In terminal
cat public/data/iot-devices.json | jq '.'
```

**Expected**:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "GreenReach Farms",
    "brand": "Unknown",
    "vendor": "Unknown",
    "protocol": "mdns",
    "type": "mdns",
    "deviceId": "mdns:GreenReach Farms._airplay._tcp.local.",
    "address": "192.168.2.93",
    "online": true,
    "trust": "trusted",
    "category": "network-service",
    "capabilities": [],
    "discoveredAt": "2025-10-17T...",
    "acceptedAt": "2025-10-17T..."
  }
]
```

### Step 5: Test View Device
1. Navigate to **IoT Devices** panel (if not already there)
2. Click **[View]** button on device card

**Expected**:
- Toast notification appears
- Shows full device JSON
- Toast stays for 10 seconds

### Step 6: Test Persistence
1. **Refresh browser** (Cmd+R / Ctrl+R)
2. Navigate to **IoT Devices** panel

**Expected Console Output**:
```
✅ [loadAllData] Loaded IoT devices: 1
```

**Expected UI**:
- Device card appears (loaded from file)
- All device details preserved
- No 404 error for iot-devices.json

### Step 7: Test Remove Device (Optional)
1. Click **[Remove]** button on device card
2. Confirm deletion in dialog

**Expected**:
- Device disappears from panel
- File updated: `public/data/iot-devices.json` now `[]`
- Success toast notification

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Seeing 400 Bad Request

**Check**:
```bash
# Verify code changes
grep -n "fetch('/data/iot-devices" public/app.charlie.js
```

**Expected Output**:
```
1729:  fetch('/data/iot-devices.json', {
2232:      const response = await fetch('/data/iot-devices.json', {
```

**If you see `/data/iot-devices` without `.json`**:
- Hard refresh didn't work (browser cache)
- Try: Cmd+Shift+R (macOS) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
- Or: Open DevTools → Network tab → Disable cache → Refresh

### Issue: Device Not Appearing in IoT Panel

**Check Console for**:
```javascript
[Log] [UniversalScan] Adding device to IoT: {...}
```

**If you see this but no card appears**:
1. Check `STATE.iotDevices`:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   STATE.iotDevices
   ```
   Should show array with device

2. Check trust level:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   STATE.iotDevices[0].trust
   ```
   Should be `"trusted"`

3. Check panel visibility:
   - Is IoT Devices panel active?
   - Is device in "Unknown Devices" table instead?

### Issue: File Not Created

**Check Server Endpoint**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8091/data/test.json \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"test":"data"}]'
```

**Expected**: `{"ok":true}`

**If Error**:
- Node.js server not running on port 8091
- DATA_DIR path issue in server-charlie.js
- File permissions issue in public/data/

## Success Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Hard refresh browser completed
- [ ] Universal Scanner runs successfully
- [ ] Accepted device shows console log: `IoT devices saved to server`
- [ ] NO 400 Bad Request error in console
- [ ] Device row disappears from scan table
- [ ] Browser navigates to IoT Devices panel
- [ ] Device appears as styled card (not in Unknown table)
- [ ] View button shows device JSON
- [ ] File created: `public/data/iot-devices.json`
- [ ] Browser refresh loads device from file
- [ ] Console shows: `Loaded IoT devices: 1` (or more)

## Next Steps After Successful Test

1. **Accept Multiple Devices**:
   - Test with different protocols (mDNS, SwitchBot, etc.)
   - Verify all appear in correct vendor groups
   - Check device count badges

2. **Test SwitchBot Credentials**:
   - Accept a SwitchBot device
   - Enter token/secret
   - Accept another SwitchBot device
   - Verify: Modal does NOT ask for credentials again

3. **Test Device Management**:
   - Use View button on different devices
   - Remove a device and verify file updates
   - Add it back and verify persistence

4. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Accept device with no IP address
   - Accept device with long name (>50 chars)
   - Accept 10+ devices, verify UI scales well
