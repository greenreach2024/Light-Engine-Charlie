    }
  ]
}
```
**Response**: Recommended wizards for each device with confidence scores

## üîÑ Integration with Discovery System

The wizard system seamlessly integrates with the network discovery engine:

1. **Automatic Discovery**: Network scanning identifies IoT devices
2. **Device Analysis**: Each device is analyzed for type and capabilities
3. **Wizard Suggestion**: Appropriate wizards are automatically suggested
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Each suggestion includes a confidence percentage
5. **Priority Ordering**: Wizards are ordered by relevance to device
