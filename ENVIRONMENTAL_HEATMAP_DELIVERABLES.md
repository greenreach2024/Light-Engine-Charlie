## üêõ Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: Uniform Heat Map with 1 Sensor
**Impact**: Heat map appears all one color  
**Cause**: Expected behavior - need 3+ sensors for gradients  
**Workaround**: Add 2 more sensors to room  
**Status**: Documented in Quick Start

### Issue 2: Missing Sensor Positions
**Impact**: Sensors don't appear on map  
**Cause**: Devices not placed in Room Mapper  
**Workaround**: Go to Room Mapper, place devices, save  
**Status**: Documented in troubleshooting

### Issue 3: Timeline Slider Stuck
**Impact**: Can't scrub through history  
**Cause**: <24 hours of data collected  
**Workaround**: Wait for full 24hr collection  
**Status**: Status bar shows data age
