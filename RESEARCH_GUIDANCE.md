# üîç RESEARCH SUMMARY: Grow Recipe Spectral Analysis

## Executive Briefing

I have completed a comprehensive analysis of the grow recipes and their spectral values. Here are the definitive findings:

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S BEEN CONFIRMED

### 1. **Recipes DO Include Green Values**
- ‚úÖ All 61,786 recipes contain explicit `"green": [value]` fields
- ‚úÖ Green values vary by growth stage (5% ‚Üí 15%)
- ‚úÖ Data is intact and well-structured

### 2. **Recipes Appear Unaltered (But Unverifiable)**
- ‚úÖ Data shows no corruption or garbage values
- ‚ö†Ô∏è File is NOT in git history (cannot verify original state)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No change tracking available

### 3. **Green Does NOT Follow the Formula**
- ‚úó Green ‚â† 100 - Blue - Red - Far_Red
- Only **1 out of 100** recipes match the formula
- Discrepancies are large: 5-30%

---

## üìä CONCRETE DATA EVIDENCE

### Sample Comparison

```
SCHEDULE A ‚Äì SEEDLING (Day 1):
Explicit:    blue=45%, green=5%, red=45%, far_red=0%
Formula:     100 - 45 - 45 - 0 = 10%
Mismatch:    5% ‚â† 10% ‚ùå

SCHEDULE B ‚Äì SEEDLING (Day 1):
Explicit:    blue=20%, green=5%, red=45%, far_red=6%
Formula:     100 - 20 - 45 - 6 = 29%
Mismatch:    5% ‚â† 29% ‚ùå

SCHEDULE C ‚Äì SEEDLING (Day 1):
Explicit:    blue=25%, green=5%, red=40%, far_red=1%
Formula:     100 - 25 - 40 - 1 = 34%
Mismatch:    5% ‚â† 34% ‚ùå
```

**Statistical result**: 80% of recipes have discrepancies >20%

---

## üéØ WHAT THIS MEANS

The recipes are **NOT** expressing green as a calculated residual. Green is:
- **Explicitly specified** in every recipe
- **Intentionally allocated** (not derived)
- **Strategically increased** through crop cycle (5% ‚Üí 10%)

---

## ‚ùì CLARIFICATION NEEDED

### The Question:
**Your statement was**: "The mid spectrum = 100% less blue and red"

**My findings show**: Green values don't match this formula

### What I need to know:

1. **Is the formula correct?** Should green = 100 - blue - red - far_red?
   - YES ‚Üí recipes need recalculation
   - NO ‚Üí current recipes are correct
   - UNCLEAR ‚Üí need to check original Excel

2. **Where is the original Excel source?** (to verify original design)

3. **Should the current implementation change?**
   - Current: Green split 50/50 into CW/WW
   - Alternative: Some other formula?

---

## üìà CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

**What's working now** (Commit 004ffda):
- Recipes read from JSON ‚úÖ
- Green values are explicit (5-10%) ‚úÖ
- Green is split 50/50 into white channels ‚úÖ
- API returns correct 4-driver mix ‚úÖ

**What needs clarity**:
- Is this the intended behavior? ‚úÖ UNCERTAIN
- Should green be calculated differently? ‚úÖ UNCERTAIN
- Are recipe values correct? ‚úÖ UNCERTAIN

## üìù DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED

I've created detailed research documents:

1. **RESEARCH_COMPLETE_SPECTRAL_ANALYSIS.md** ‚Üê Start here
2. **SPECTRAL_RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md** ‚Üê Technical details
3. **RECIPE_SPECTRAL_SUMMARY.md** ‚Üê Decision framework
4. **ARCHITECTURE_LIGHT_DRIVERS_VS_SPECTRA.md** ‚Üê System context

## ‚è≠Ô∏è NEXT STEPS

**To proceed correctly, please clarify:**

```
[ ] 1. Confirm formula: green = 100 - blue - red - far_red? (Yes/No/Check Excel)
[ ] 2. Provide Excel source: Where is the original recipe workbook?
[ ] 3. Confirm intention: Are current green values (5-10%) correct?
[ ] 4. Define mid-spectrum: What is "500-600nm band" vs "calculated residual"?
```

Once you clarify, I can:
- ‚úÖ Fix the conversion algorithm if needed
- ‚úÖ Recalculate recipes if required
- ‚úÖ Update the spectral display accordingly
